## About Me

- My name is Josh Parker.
- 🌐🕸️🕷️ I'm a web enjoyer 🕷️🕸️🌐.
- 🖥️🔧🐒 I do silly internet tricks 🐒🔧🖥️.

## What is this organization?

I have too many repos on my github. So, I created this organization to have a nice, clean place to put only my portfolio repos.

## Planned repos:

- This readme repo.
- The repos for the Mundane project.
  1. Mundane react web client
  2. Mundane node express backend
  3. Mundane postman test suite
  4. Mundane ASP.Net backend
  5. Mundane Java Spring Boot backend
  6. Mundane Ruby on Rails backend
  7. Mundane PHP Laravel backend
  8. Mundane Python Django backend

The plan is not to create all of these repos at once! Instead, I will work on only one repo at a time until it is complete, and only then move on to the next!
